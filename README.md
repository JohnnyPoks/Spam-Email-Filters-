## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an effective spam email filter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The filters are designed to identify and classify spam emails with high accuracy, leveraging 2 of various machine learning algorithms and text processing methods.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing email data for analysis, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training various machine learning models, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
